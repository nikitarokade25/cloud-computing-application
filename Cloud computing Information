Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources like servers, storage, and software over the internet, allowing users to pay only for what they use instead of owning and managing their own physical hardware. This model provides flexibility, scalability, and potential cost savings by outsourcing infrastructure to providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Services are accessed via the internet, similar to how services like Netflix or Google Docs work.  
Core concepts
Delivery of services: Cloud computing delivers a range of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more—over the internet. 
On-demand access: Users can access these resources as needed, without the need to buy, own, or maintain physical data centers and servers. 
Pay-as-you-go pricing: Users are typically charged only for the services they consume, similar to a utility like electricity. 
Remote servers: The data is stored on remote servers managed by cloud providers, not on a user's local hard drive.
